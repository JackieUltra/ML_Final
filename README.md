# ML Final project CDD203
Comparing Different ML models on Toxicity Dataset

This github repo is all of the code used in to the paper Building Machine Learning Models to Determine hERG Blockade Potential of Compounds

To get started, fork this repository onto your own GitHub, once in desired directory use command

$> git clone https://github.com/JackieUltra/ML_Final.git

Once forked create a virtual environment in the file using the command

$> conda env create -f Karim_env.yaml

then 

$> conda activate Karim_env

Once completed you will be able to run all code in the Karim_hERG.ipynb however please run all codeblocks in order or they will not work. Optional code blocks are specifically stated; everything else is mandatory to run in order. 

NOTE: some blocks may take up to 40 minutes on a laptop.


This is all the code that was used in the paper however there were some hypertuning parameters that you can play with if you have more computational power in the file Karim_hERG_hypertune.ipynb. Again, execute all code blocks in order for proper results. The # avoid running notes if you are on a laptop and dont have access to more compute power.
